## JavaScript

### Introduction

 **Javascript**: is a prograaming langauge which works as the brain of the web page. It works to make the web page interactive by **modifying** and and **accessing** the content of the web page. 

And by adding **program rules** to specify the instruction for a browser to follow. Then **react to events** which is the script that will run when an event occurs and this triggered by the user.

**Script**: *it is a series of instructions which a computer to follow to fulfill a goal.*

The script can be considered as the same as: recpies,manuals or handbooks.

The browser can use any part of the script depending on the user interact on the web page.

Before writing a script things need to be made, which are:
- State the goal you want to achieve 
- List all the tasks that are needed for the goal to be completed.

So steps to achieve a goal:

1- Define the goal 
2- Design the script
3- Code each step

**Experssions**: 

There are two experssions:

1- Expressions that just assign a value to a variable.
2- Experssions that use two or more values to return a single value.

**Operators**: they are used to create a single value from one or more values, and they are used in *Experssion*. 

Examples of operators:
- Assignment operators 
- Arithmetic operators 
- String operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators

In Arithmetic operators you need to pay attention to the order if more than one operator is used in one experssion.

String operators have only one string operator which the + symbol, that used to join the strings.
