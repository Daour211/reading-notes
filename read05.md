## Comparison and logical operators: 150-151, 156, and 157:

**Comparison Operators**:

 1- **==**: used to compare two values to check if are the same.<br>
 2- **!=**: used to compare two values to check if are not the same.<br>
 3- **===**: used to compare two values & to check if they have the same data type and value as well.<br>
 4- **!==**: used to compare two values & to check if they do not have the same data type and value as well.<br>
 5- **>**: to check if the number on left is greater than the number on the right.<br>
 6- **<**: to check if the number on left is less than the number on the right.<br> 
 7- **>=**>: to check if the number on left is greater equalthan the number on the right. <br>
 8- **<=**: to check if the number on left is less than or equal the number on the right.

**Logic Operators**:
Comparison opeartors return a vlues of true or false. The logic operator allows to compare between the results of the comparison operators.

 1- **&&**: used to test more than one condition. Both expersions needs to be true to return value as true, otherwise it will return false.<br>
 2- **||**: used to test at least one condition. Both expersions needs to be false to return value as false, otherwise it will return true.<br>
 3- **!**: used to take a single Boolean value and invert its value. It means if the statement was false it will return true, and vice versa

## for & while loops: 170 - 173, and 176

**Loops**: it checks the condition and if it returns true then the code in the block will run, and it shall repeat the process by checking the condition agian until the returned value if false.

Three types of loops:

- **for**: used to run a code for specific number of times, and the condition usually is a counter.
- **while**: used when you do not know how many times you want to run the code.
- **do while**: it is almost the same as *while loop* but with one difference that it runs the statment inside the curly braces at least once.

*loop counter*: used by the **for loop** as a condition.

The condition of the *for loops* made up of three statments:
 1- Initialization: create and set a vairble to 0. 
 2- Condition: used to keep running the loop until it reaches a specified number.
 3- Update: Each time the loop run the statment in the curly braces, it will add one to the counter.
