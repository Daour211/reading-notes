# What Google Learned About Teams

At begining of this article, it tells a short story about the experience of Julia Rozovsky with working with teams, showig the ups and downs of this experience. 

The term **data-saturated** age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of. It is very important to have a studies about the team from the team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves.

Then it presents the project that Google has done about Teams.

In 2012, Google company embarked on an initiative — code-named Project Aristotle — to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared. 

Project Aristotle’s researchers began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked. 

The project found that the company's teams had no defined pattern to be considered as an ideal one or to be considered as model, rather they had different set of patterns.

So they found out that each group has its own **norms**. **Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather**. Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound.  

Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams. 

Project Aristotle’s researchers began searching through the data they had collected, looking for norms.


<!-- In 2008, a group of psychologists from Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Union College began to try to answer a question very much like this one. ‘‘Over the past century, psychologists made considerable progress in defining and systematically measuring intelligence in individuals,’’ the researchers wrote in the journal Science in 2010. ‘‘We have used the statistical approach they developed for individual intelligence to systematically measure the intelligence of groups.’’ Put differently, the researchers wanted to know if there is a collective I. Q. that emerges within a team that is distinct from the smarts of any single member. -->

- *The researchers of group of psychologists from Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Union College eventually* concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.

Two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared:
 - **First**, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’

 - **Second**, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.

Then the researcher of Aristotle Project fouced in the term "**psychological safety**" and its imporatnce and how it affects the teams.

What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor.
