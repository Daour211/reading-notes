## nosql vs sql

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:<br>
|   SQL            | NoSQL                                              |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)|NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.|
| SQL databases are table based databases| NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
|SQL databases have predefined schema|NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.|
|SQL databases are vertically scalable.
SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware.|NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load|
|SQL databases uses SQL (structured query language) for defining and manipulating the data|NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents.|

Q1) What does SQL stand for?<br>
It stands for Structured Query Language

Q2) What is a relational database?<br>

Q3) What type of structure does a relational database work with?<br>
One-to-One
One-to-Many

Q4) What is a ‘schema’?<br>
It refers to the way of organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed. The fields where to have the data 

Q5) What is a NoSQL database?<br>
NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. And it is a database that stores a lot of data in an efficient way 

Q6) How does it work?<br>
We have collections, and inside them we have documents where the data is assigned 

Q7) What is inside of a Mongo database?<br>
Collections and inside them we have documents 

Q8) Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.<br>
MongoDB, because it does not have schema 

Q9) What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?<br>
Having duplicate data
