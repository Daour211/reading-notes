## Growth mindset

**Growth Mindset** is like a state of mind to *believe that the person abilities can be developed and enhanced through perseverance and effort*,it is not just about talent or intelligence that would be sufficient for anything. So the growth mindset is all about leraing and keep pusing forward.

Unlike the fixed mindset which is only about the talent or the intellginece.

Some quotes which explains **Growth Mindset** in simple words: 
 >Great works are performed, not by strength, but by perseverance.
 
 >It's not that Im so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.

Here some issues that you can encounter them by the Growth mindset:

1- **Challenges**: it is the part that where you improve yourself, and not to stand down

2- **Effort**: this part can be very hard to do, but the key is here to overcome any temptation that may stop you from doing what you have to.

3- **Critcism**: always think of the critcism as an advice to foucs on improving the aspect and get it right in the next time, and on the other hand do not forget the success that you accomplished. 

4- **Success of others**: learn from their success as much as you can and think that they did not get their knowledge or works just by their talent or intellgince, they worked hard for that.
